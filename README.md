# Eurovision Flask Dashboard

### CS50 Final Project
For the final project of [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) (Harvard's introductory computer science course), I decided to set up a [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) dashboard for display Eurovision Song Contest results. I wanted to learn how to display [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) charts in a Flask web application. Udacity's data scientist [nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) program - particularly its web development lesson module - inspired the development of this project.
