# Eurovision Flask Dashboard

### CS50 Final Project
For the final project of CS50 (Harvard's introductory computer science course), I decided to set up a [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) dashboard for display Eurovision Song Contest results.
I wanted to try displaying [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) charts on a Flask web application.
